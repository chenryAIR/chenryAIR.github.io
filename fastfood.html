      <h2>Why This Project?</h2>
      <p>
        Retail data often comes in weekly panel format with uneven performance across locations. This project mirrors real-world business experimentation where you need to compare promotions while accounting for store-level differences and repeated measures. It gave me the opportunity to demonstrate proper handling of clustered data, time structure, and model robustness.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p></p>

        <p>
            Before estimating the effect of each promotion on weekly sales, I conducted a series of data checks to ensure the validity of the analysis.
        </p>

        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>
            The dataset included four weeks of sales data per store, with each store randomly assigned to one of three promotional conditions. 
            The unit of analysis was the <strong>store-week</strong>, resulting in repeated observations per store. 
            To account for this, I used <strong>clustered standard errors at the store level</strong> in all regression models.
        </p>

        <h3>Randomization and Covariate Balance</h3>
        <p>
            To confirm that the promotion assignment was successfully randomized, I checked:
            <ul>
            <li>Group sizes and their distribution across market sizes (via value_counts and pd.crosstab)</li>
            <li>Balance on store age using group means and <strong>standardized mean differences (SMDs)</strong> between treatment groups</li>
            </ul>
            All SMDs were below 0.2 except for Promo 3, which had a slightly older average store age, suggesting only mild imbalance.
        </p>

        <h3>Exploratory Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            I explored the relationship between potential covariates and weekly sales:
            <ul>
            <li>Calculated <strong>Pearson correlation</strong> between store age and sales</li>
            <li>Created <strong>scatterplots</strong> and <strong>boxplots</strong> to assess distribution and skew</li>
            <li>Plotted <strong>sales over time</strong> by week and promotion group to assess time trends</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Outlier Detection and Removal</h3>
        <p>
            Using the <strong>interquartile range (IQR)</strong> method, I identified and removed extreme sales values within each promotion group. 
            This reduced the influence of outliers and improved the symmetry of the outcome distribution.
        </p>

        <h3>Outcome Transformation</h3>
        <p>
            To account for right-skew in sales, I applied a <strong>log transformation</strong> using log1p(SalesInThousands). 
            This stabilized variance and reduced the impact of high-end values on model results.
        </p>

        <h3>Modeling Approach</h3>
        <p>
            I ran a series of <strong>OLS regression models</strong>, progressively adjusting for:
            <ul>
            <li>Promotion group (categorical)</li>
            <li>Store age (continuous)</li>
            <li>Market size (categorical)</li>
            <li>Week (categorical, in exploratory models)</li>
            </ul>
            Standard errors were clustered by store to account for within-store correlation. 
            I compared models with and without outliers, and with both raw and log-transformed outcomes, to assess the robustness of results.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="section">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        I tested the impact of three promotional strategies on weekly sales using a series of OLS regression models. 
        Models included controls for market size and store age, and used <strong>clustered standard errors</strong> to account for repeated measures within each store. 
        Results were evaluated with and without outliers, and using both raw and log-transformed versions of the outcome variable.
    </p>

    <h3>Primary Findings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Promotion 2</strong> consistently and significantly <span style="color:red;">reduced sales</span> compared to Promotion 1 across all model specifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Promotion 3</strong> showed <em>no statistically significant difference</em> from Promotion 1 in any model.</li>
        <li><strong>Market size</strong> was a strong predictor of sales: stores in medium and small markets earned significantly less than those in large markets.</li>
        <li><strong>Store age</strong> did not have a meaningful impact on weekly sales.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Effect Sizes</h3>
    <p>
        In the final model using <strong>log-transformed sales without outliers</strong>:
        <ul>
        <li>Promotion 2 reduced weekly sales by approximately <strong>23%</strong> compared to Promotion 1 (p &lt; 0.001).</li>
        <li>Promotion 3 resulted in a non-significant change of ~2.6% lower sales.</li>
        <li>Stores in medium markets saw ~36% lower sales than those in large markets; small market stores earned ~10% less.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Robustness Checks</h3>
    <p>
        Results were consistent across:
        <ul>
        <li>Raw sales and log-transformed sales</li>
        <li>Models with and without outlier removal</li>
        <li>Models including and excluding week fixed effects (no evidence of time trends)</li>
        </ul>
        Although residuals showed mild non-normality and some autocorrelation (Durbin-Watson &lt; 1), the use of clustered standard errors addressed these issues.
    </p>

    <h3>Visualization</h3>
    <p>
        Plots of weekly sales over time confirmed that promotion effects were stable across the 4-week period. 
        Histograms and boxplots showed a right-skewed distribution of sales, justifying the use of a log transformation. 
        Outliers identified via the IQR method were primarily concentrated in smaller markets and higher sales values.
